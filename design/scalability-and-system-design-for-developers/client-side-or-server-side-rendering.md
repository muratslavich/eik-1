# Client-Side or Server-Side rendering

### Client-Side

For rendering HTML DOM the browser uses different components:

* Browser engine
* Rendering engine
* JavaScript interpreter
* UI backend
* Data storage etc.

### Server-Side

To avoid all client loading, the server generates HTML and directly sends it.

* for delivering static content
* Not fit with AJAX requests

### Hybrid approach

We can use server-side rendering for the home page and for the other static content on our website and use client-side rendering for the dynamic pages.
