# how disable all ports on ubuntu host except 80 for external connection



To disable all ports on an Ubuntu host except port 80 for external connections, you can use a firewall program such as `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall), which is included with Ubuntu by default.

Here are the steps to configure `ufw` to allow incoming traffic on port 80 and deny all other incoming traffic:

1.  First, check the status of `ufw` with the following command:

    ```lua
    luaCopy codesudo ufw status
    ```

    If `ufw` is not enabled, you can enable it with the command:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codesudo ufw enable
    ```
2.  Allow incoming traffic on port 80:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codesudo ufw allow 80/tcp
    ```

    This command will add a rule to allow incoming TCP traffic on port 80.
3.  Deny all other incoming traffic:

    ```arduino
    arduinoCopy codesudo ufw default deny incoming
    ```

    This command will set the default policy to deny all incoming traffic.
4.  Verify the rules:

    ```lua
    luaCopy codesudo ufw status verbose
    ```

    This command will display the current rules in `ufw`. You should see a rule allowing incoming traffic on port 80 and a default policy of denying all other incoming traffic.

That's it! Your Ubuntu host should now be configured to allow incoming connections on port 80 and deny all other incoming traffic.

Yes, other applications running on the Ubuntu host would still be able to use other ports for internal interactions. The firewall rules you configured will only apply to incoming traffic, not outgoing traffic or traffic within the local network.

So, if you have other services or applications running on your Ubuntu host that require communication on ports other than port 80, they will still be able to communicate with each other internally using those ports.

The `ufw` firewall only filters incoming traffic based on the rules you set up. Outgoing traffic is not filtered by default, so any application running on the host can initiate outbound connections to other hosts and services on any port unless you configure additional rules to restrict outgoing traffic.

To allow incoming traffic on ports 80, 443, and 22 using `ufw`, you can follow these steps:

1.  Allow incoming traffic on port 80:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codesudo ufw allow 80/tcp
    ```
2.  Allow incoming traffic on port 443:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codesudo ufw allow 443/tcp
    ```
3.  Allow incoming traffic on port 22:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codesudo ufw allow 22/tcp
    ```
4.  Verify the rules:

    ```lua
    luaCopy codesudo ufw status verbose
    ```

    This command will display the current rules in `ufw`. You should see rules allowing incoming traffic on ports 80, 443, and 22.

That's it! Your Ubuntu host should now be configured to allow incoming connections on ports 80, 443, and 22. If you want to allow any other ports, you can follow the same pattern of using `sudo ufw allow` followed by the port number and the protocol (TCP or UDP) as necessary.

Yes, you can configure `ufw` using a configuration file, which can be useful if you want to deploy the same firewall rules to multiple machines or if you want to automate the configuration process.

Here are the steps to configure `ufw` using a configuration file:

1.  Open the `/etc/ufw/ufw.conf` file in a text editor with root privileges:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codesudo nano /etc/ufw/ufw.conf
    ```
2.  Uncomment the `ENABLED` variable by removing the `#` at the beginning of the line:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codeENABLED=yes
    ```

    This will enable `ufw` on your system.
3.  Add the firewall rules you want to apply to the `ufw` configuration file. For example, to allow incoming traffic on ports 80, 443, and 22, you would add the following lines:

    ```bash
    bashCopy code# Allow incoming traffic on port 80
    ufw allow 80/tcp

    # Allow incoming traffic on port 443
    ufw allow 443/tcp

    # Allow incoming traffic on port 22
    ufw allow 22/tcp
    ```

    You can add any additional firewall rules you need in the same format.
4. Save the file and exit the text editor.
5.  Reload `ufw` to apply the new configuration:

    ```
    Copy codesudo ufw reload
    ```

That's it! Your Ubuntu host should now be configured with the firewall rules you specified in the `ufw` configuration file.

To deny all other incoming traffic except the ports you have explicitly allowed in the `ufw` configuration file, you can add the following line at the end of the file:

```arduino
arduinoCopy codeufw default deny incoming
```

This will set the default policy to deny all incoming traffic that is not explicitly allowed in the configuration file.

Here's an example of what your `/etc/ufw/ufw.conf` file might look like with the firewall rules for ports 80, 443, and 22, and the default policy to deny all other incoming traffic:

```bash
bashCopy code# /etc/ufw/ufw.conf
#
# Set to yes to enable ufw
ENABLED=yes

# Allow incoming traffic on port 80
ufw allow 80/tcp

# Allow incoming traffic on port 443
ufw allow 443/tcp

# Allow incoming traffic on port 22
ufw allow 22/tcp

# Set the default policy to deny all other incoming traffic
ufw default deny incoming
```

Remember to save the file and reload `ufw` with `sudo ufw reload` for the changes to take effect.
