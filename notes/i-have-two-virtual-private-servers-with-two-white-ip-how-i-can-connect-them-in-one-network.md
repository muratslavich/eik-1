There are several ways to connect two virtual private servers (VPS) with two white IP addresses together into one network. Here are three possible methods:

1. VPN (Virtual Private Network): You can set up a VPN between the two VPS to create a secure and private network connection. You will need to install and configure a VPN server software on one of the VPS and a VPN client software on the other VPS. OpenVPN is a popular open-source VPN software that you can use for this purpose.
2. VLAN (Virtual LAN): You can create a VLAN on each VPS and then connect the two VLANs together. VLANs allow you to segment your network and create isolated subnetworks. You can configure your VPS networking settings to allow VLAN tagging and set up the VLANs using a VLAN-capable switch.
3. Direct Connection: You can connect the two VPS together directly using a crossover cable or a switch. This method requires you to have physical access to the VPS and may require some network configuration on the VPS. You will also need to assign IP addresses to each VPS interface and configure routing to allow traffic to flow between them.

Note that each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, so you should choose the one that best fits your needs and technical capabilities.

To give names to hosts in your network, you need to set up a Domain Name System (DNS) server. DNS is a distributed system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers can use to locate and communicate with each other.

Here are the steps to set up a DNS server:

1. Choose a DNS server software: There are several DNS server software options available, including BIND, PowerDNS, and dnsmasq. Choose the one that best fits your needs and technical capabilities.
2. Install and configure the DNS server: Install the DNS server software on a dedicated server or one of the hosts in your network. Follow the installation and configuration instructions for the specific DNS server software you choose.
3. Create a domain name: Decide on a domain name for your network, such as "mycompany.com".
4. Add hostnames and IP addresses to the DNS server: Add the hostname and IP address of each host in your network to the DNS server's configuration file. This will allow other hosts on the network to resolve the hostname to the correct IP address.
5. Configure hosts to use the DNS server: Configure each host on your network to use the DNS server for name resolution. This can usually be done by editing the "/etc/resolv.conf" file on Linux/Unix-based systems, or the network adapter settings on Windows-based systems.

Once you have set up your DNS server and configured your hosts to use it, you can use hostnames to identify and communicate with hosts on your network.
