# HTTP Caching

{% embed url="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching" %}

Caching is a technique that stores a copy of a given resource and serves it back when requested. When a web cache has a requested resource in its store, it intercepts the request and returns a copy of the stored resource instead of redownloading the resource from the originating server.

* Shared cache - response can use more than one user
* Private cache - dedicated to a single user



* Browser cache
* Proxy cache
* Gateway cache
* CDN
